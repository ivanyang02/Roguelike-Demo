# Roguelike-Demo

Rewrote my Java Dungeon Generator and added some game elements.

Made in Unity with C#. Green tiles are portals to the next floor, and yellow tiles are doors that obstruct vision. As of right now, getting spotted by an enemy locks you in place, so fog of war is transparent.

Use the WASD keys to move around.
